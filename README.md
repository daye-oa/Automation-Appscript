# Automation-Appscript


Managing consultations can be tedious, but automation can make it seamless. By integrating Google Apps Script with Google Sheets, I built a system that:

Automates email confirmations for clients.

Creates Google Calendar events for each consultation.

Sends follow-up emails and reminders without any manual work!

The Problem:
Before automation, managing consultations involved manually sending confirmation emails, setting calendar reminders, and following up with clients. This process was time-consuming and prone to errors.

The Solution:
By leveraging Google Sheets and Google Apps Script, I built an automated system that:

Triggers confirmation emails when a consultation is booked.

Creates Google Calendar events with the correct time and details.

Sends follow-up emails after consultations to gather feedback.

The Impact:
Increased efficiency and accuracy.

Reduced manual work by over 50%.

Improved client engagement with timely follow-ups.
